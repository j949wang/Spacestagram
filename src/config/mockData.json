    "explanation": "How do dying stars eject their outer layers?  Stars that create elegant planetary nebulas like Henize 3-401, pictured above, are not unusual, causing speculation that, one day, our own Sun may look like this.  Henize 3-401 is one of the most elongated planetary nebulas yet discovered, a particularly odd feat for a seemingly round star.  Perhaps, some astronomers hypothesize, the elongated shape gives a clue to the expulsion mechanism.  Genesis hypotheses include that the outer layers of gas are funneled out by the star's own magnetic field, and that a second unseen star is somehow involved.  After the gas disperses in a few thousand years, only a white dwarf star will remain.  Henize 3-401 lies about 10,000 light years away toward the constellation of Carina.",

    "explanation": "How similar in size are the Earth and the Moon?  A dramatic visual answer to this question is found by combining photographs taken by the Mariner 10 spacecraft that headed out toward Venus and Mercury in 1973.  The Moon can be seen to have a diameter over one quarter that of Earth, relatively large compared to its planetary companion.  In our Solar System, only Pluto and Charon are closer together in size.  Striking features of the Earth visible to the passing spacecraft include blue oceans and white clouds, showing the Earth to be truly a water world.",
